  ## Description 
  This is a simple python application which can be used to extract product name and price information from eBay URLs.
  
  I've built this application to practice python basics such as:

  - Using BeautifulSoup module to scrape data from websites
  - Writing Python functions

## Usage
To use the application:

1. Launch the application
2. Paste ebay product URL
3. The program will return product name and current price

 ## Contributing
I developed this app following the instructions from https://automatetheboringstuff.com python course.
