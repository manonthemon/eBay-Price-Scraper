  ## Description 
  This is a simple python application which can be used to extract product name and price information from eBay URLs.
  
  I've built this application to practice python basics such as:

  - Using BeautifulSoup module to scrape data from websites
  - Writing Python functions

## Usage
To use the application:

1. Copy URL of an ebay product page.
2. Paste it to as the value of the url variable in the code in IDLE.
3. Run the program. 

 ## Contributing
I developed this app following the instructions from https://automatetheboringstuff.com python course.
